## Description:

It is require to build a FrontEnd application to connect to the previous API ( manages transactions of goods through different operations).

The elements that form this project are lists, creation form, update form, delete for:

    ·   Products (deletion turns into disable)

    ·   Suppliers

    ·   Price Reduction

    ·   Ticket

    ·   User: Admin Only

    ·   Reports

The app will be used for completing the next tasks:

    ·   Login: An authentication access to the different operations.
    
    ·   Detailled information from each item.

    ·   Item CRUD: Creation, reading, update and deletion (in this case,disable by turnin into "Discounted" and reasoning it into "reports").

    ·  An option to associate a supplier should be included. An option to insert price reduction should be implemented.
